This undergraduate project was developed in collaboration with [**Nian Electronic Company**](https://nianelectronic.net/en) to implement predictive maintenance for Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) batteries in UPS systems. The project implements the methodology from the research paper [*"Predictive Maintenance of VRLA Batteries in UPS towards Reliable Data Centers"*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240589632031185X)using a Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GDBT) model.

The system predicts VRLA battery deterioration in advance for the company's UPS systems, helping prevent unexpected failures and optimize maintenance scheduling. Key features include:
- **Battery Health Monitoring**: Real-time assessment of battery condition using performance metrics
- **Deterioration Prediction**: Early warning system for battery replacement needs  
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced downtime and extended battery lifespan through intelligent maintenance

The implementation processes battery voltage, internal resistance, temperature data, and historical maintenance records to provide accurate predictions for critical infrastructure applications.
