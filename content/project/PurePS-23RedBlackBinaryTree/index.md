Implemented a 2-3Red-Black Tree based on the “Parity-Seeking” deletion algorithm from a recent academic paper <mark>[[Link]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00236-023-00452-6)</mark>. The project focused on reusability and object-oriented design in C++, structured as a library-like module.


This implementation provides a pedagogically sound yet efficient approach to deletion in 2-3 red-black trees, making it suitable for educational or competitive programming use.
