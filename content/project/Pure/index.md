Implemented a Red-Black Tree based on the “Parity-Seeking” deletion algorithm from a recent academic paper. The project focused on reusability and object-oriented design in C++, structured as a library-like module.


This implementation provides a pedagogically sound yet efficient approach to deletion in red-black trees, making it suitable for educational or competitive programming use.
