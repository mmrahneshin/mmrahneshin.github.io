Sepehr is an automatic scoring system developed for programming exercises, with a particular focus on data structures and algorithm design problems. It was initially created during my internship at Part Research Institute and later used in both <mark>[university-level](https://part.institute/events/%da%86%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b4-%d8%af%db%8c%d8%aa%d8%a7%d9%84%db%8c%da%af-%d8%a7%d8%b3%d8%b7%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%87%d9%87%d8%a7%db%8c-%d8%b3%d8%a7%d8%ae%d8%aa%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%af%d8%a7%d8%af%d9%87/)</mark> and <mark>[national-level](https://part.institute/events/%d9%81%d8%b5%d9%84-%d8%af%d9%88%d9%85-%da%86%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b4-%d8%af%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%b4%d8%ac%d9%88%db%8c%db%8c-%d8%af%db%8c%d8%aa%d8%a7%d9%84%db%8c%da%af/)</mark> Dataleague programming contests.

The system automates the evaluation of code submissions, streamlining the process of grading and feedback for competitive programming and coursework. It has been actively used in:
- **Data Structures and Algorithm Design courses** at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad,
- The **University-level Dataleague Contest** (2023–2024),
- And the **National Dataleague Contest** (2024–2025).

Sepehr is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, enabling flexible integration into different contest platforms and academic environments.
