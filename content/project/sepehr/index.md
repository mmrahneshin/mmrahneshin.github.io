Sepehr is an automatic scoring system developed for programming exercises, with a particular focus on data structures and algorithm design problems. It was initially created during my internship at Part Research Institute and later used in both university-level and national-level Dataleague programming contests.

The system automates the evaluation of code submissions, streamlining the process of grading and feedback for competitive programming and coursework. It has been actively used in:
- **Data Structures and Algorithm Design courses** at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad,
- The **FUM-level Dataleague Contest** (2023–2024),
- And the **National Dataleague Contest** (2024–2025).

Sepehr is designed with modularity and scalability in mind, enabling flexible integration into different contest platforms and academic environments.
