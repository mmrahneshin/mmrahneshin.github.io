## About Me

I‚Äôm a BSc Computer Engineering student at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad with a strong focus on AI, machine learning, and data structures. My undergraduate project explores predictive maintenance for VRLA batteries using deep learning.

I‚Äôve led national-level programming contests as the Exercise Design Team Lead for Dataleague and developed ‚ÄúSepehr,‚Äù an automatic scoring system for evaluating algorithmic problems. My work also includes projects in transfer learning, seizure classification, and intelligent agents.

As a Teaching Assistant for Data Structures and Algorithm Design over five semesters, I enjoy sharing knowledge and mentoring others. I‚Äôm driven by building intelligent systems and creating tools that bridge research and education.
