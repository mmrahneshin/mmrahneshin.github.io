## About Me

Iâ€™m a BSc Computer Engineering student at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad with a strong focus on AI, machine learning, and data structures. My undergraduate project is an industry collaboration with [Nian Electronic Company](https://nianelectronic.net/en), where I implemented the approach from the research paper [*"Predictive Maintenance of VRLA Batteries in UPS towards Reliable Data Centers"*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240589632031185X) using a GDBT model to predict VRLA battery deterioration in advance for the companyâ€™s UPS systems.

I've directed national-level programming contests as Dataleague's Exercise Design Team Lead and designed an automatic judging system, "Sepehr," for algorithmic problems. My projects further extend across transfer learning, seizure classification, and playing agents.

As Teaching Assistant to Data Structures and Algorithm Design for five semesters, I enjoy spreading knowledge and mentoring students. I am especially interested in applying AI to practical uses and building instruments that ease research and learning.
